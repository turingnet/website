            <div class="subtitle">AI Models are controlled by centralized owners</div>
            <div class="text">
	    Models in a centralized AI system often owned by tech giants like Google, Amazon, etc. These models and the processes of training and inferencing are only accessible internally. This problem is one of the biggest concerns of AI from general public.
	    </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Waste and imbalance of computation powers</div>
            <div class="text">
	    Typical AI system requires massive computation powers in model training and inference. Multiple centralized systems have built their own data centers but not shared to each other, which lead to enormous resource waste. There is a great opportunity to organize computation powers from public in a decentralized but trustable way.
	    </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Public is not incentivized to train and use AI</div>
            <div class="text">
	    General public cannot participate in AI. One of the major reasons is that they are not incentivized on centralized AI systems. Owners of the centralized AI systems are not obligated to pay people who want to contribute their computation powers, as they all possess large data centers with much lower cost per unit power. The ecosystem then separates the public from these big companies, who further strengthens their owned centralized AI systems and models.
	    </div>
            <div class="subtitle">High operational cost</div>
            <div class="text">
	    Centralized AI systems are operated by different owners separately. Although the cost per unit power is lower, the scale of these systems often lead to enormous cost to run. Such high cost may pressure the owners to perform malicious business activities for maximizing profits.
	    </div>
            <div class="subtitle">Data privacy</div>
            <div class="text">
	    Training and optimizing AI models require large amount of data. The primary sources of such training data are from user characteristics and interactions, such as genome, faces, user behaviors on clicking ads, etc.. These private data are highly sensitive. The black box of a centralized AI system has no audition on how the data are being used.
